#####Body#####

1. THE EAGLE AND THE ROBINThe political moral of this little apologue is too evident to need any other comment, than barely mentioning that the lady was Queen Anne; deſiring the reader to recollect the change which ſhe made in her miniſtry in 1709, the year in which this poem was written; and referring to Dr. King's "Rufinus, or the Favourite," in the Engliſh Poets, vol. XX. •. 367 N., An APOLOGUE; tranſlated from the Original of AESOP, written Two Thouſand Years ſince, and now rendered in familiar Verſe by H. G. L. Mag.
GOOD precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity. And here I preſent my good reader
    _ THE EAGLE AND THE ROBIN.

1. BIBLIOTHECA: A POEM. OCCASIONED BY THE SIGHT OF A MODERN LIBRARY. WITH SOME VERY USEFUL EPISODES AND DIGRESSIONS.

1. EPISTLE TO MR. GODDARDTaken from an admirable banter of our author's, intituled,
"Two Friendly Letters from honeſt Tom Boggy, to the Rev. Mr. Goddard, Canon of Windſor,"
very proper to be racked to the Canon's Sermon;" firſt printed in 8vo, 1710. This Sermon (full of high treaſon againſt High-church, Hereditary Right, and Sacheverell) was intituled,
"The Guilt, Miſchief, and Aggravation of Cenſure; ſet forth in a Sermon preached in St. George's Chapel within her Majeſty's Caſtle of Windſor, on Sunday the 25th of June, 1710. By Thomas Goddard, A.M. Canon of Windſor. London, printed for B. Lintot, 1710."
 — Mr. Goddard was inſtalled canon May 26, 1707, and was alſo rector of St. Bennet Finch, London. He publiſhed a 30th of January Sermon, in 4to, 1703; and
"The Mercy of God to this Church and Kingdom, exemplified in the ſeveral Inſtances of it, from the Beginning of the Reformation down to the preſent Time. A Sermon preached in St. George's Chapel at Windſor, on Tueſday the 7th of November, the Day of Thankſgiving, 1710,"

1. THE DREAM, BY MR. J. TALBOTWho this J. Talbot was, I cannot diſcover; but there was a tranſlation of Seneca's Troas, by J. T. publiſhed in 1686; and in a copy thrown out of Lord Bathurſt's Library, which I ſaw, the laſt initial was filled up with the name of Talbot, and I have no doubt but he is the ſame perſon. R.. OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF LADY SEYMOURLady Elizabeth Seymour, daughter to William lord Allington, of Horſheath, in the county of Cambridge; ſhe was the ſecond lady of Charles lord Seymour of Trowbridge, and mother to Francis and Charles ſucceſſively dukes of Somerſet.

N., SPOKEN IN THE THEATRE AT OXFORD,

1. TO A PERSON OF HONOURThe honourable Edward Howard, by his poem called "The Britiſh Princes," engaged the attention of by far the moſt eminent of his contemporaries; who played upon his vanity, as the wits of half a century before had done on that of Thomas Coriat, by writing extravagant compliments on his work. See Butler's verſes, in the Engliſh Poets, vol. VII. p. 197; Waller's, vol. VIII. p. 179; Denham's, vol. IX. p. 143; Sprat's, in the ſame volume, p. 162; and the Duke of Dorſet's, vol. XI. p. 187.

1. THE APPARITION, BY ABEL EVANSDr. Abel Evans, the author of this and the following poems, though a man of genius, the friend of the firſt poets of the times, and applauded by them, is now hardly known. He is generally ſtyled Dr. Evans the Epigrammiſt, and was one of the Oxford wits enumerated in the following diſtich (wretchedly imitated in the "Additions to Pope," vol. I. p. 163.):
" Alma novem genuit celebres Rhedycina poetas;" Bub, Stubb, Cobb, Crabb, Trapp, Young, Carey, Tickell, Evans."
He is likewiſe mentioned in the Dunciad, B. II. ver. 116. in company with Dr. Young and Dean Swift, as one of the authors whoſe works had been claimed by James More Smith. Dr. Evans was of St. John the Baptiſt's College, Oxford; and took the degree of M.A. March 23, 1699; that of B.D. April 26, 1705; and D.D. May 16, 1711. He was burſar to his college; vicar of St. Gyles's, Oxford; and appears to have been intimate with Mr. Pope, to whom there are two letters by him in print, in one of which the initial letter W. (intended for his Chriſtian name) is by miſtake put inſtead of that by which he uſed to ſign himſelf. R., D.D. OCCASIONED BY THE PUBLICATION OF TINDAL'S RIGHTS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.

1. ON THE SAME.

1. ON DR. TADLOWOf this gentleman little is known, but that he was remarkably fat. The following ſhorter epigram on his bulk is probably by Dr. Evans:
" When Tadlow walks the ſtreets, the pa•iours cry," God bleſs you, Sir! and lay their rammers by.".

1. DR. CONYERS This epigram, with the following variations, is aſcribed to Dr. Tadlow in the "Additions to Pope," vol. I. p. 132.
" Indulgent Nature to each kind beſtowsA ſecret inſtinct to diſcern its foes.The gooſe, a ſilly bird, yet knows the ſox;Hares fly from dogs, and ſailors ſteer from rocks:This rogue the gallows for his fate foreſees,And bears a like antipathy to trees." TO DR. EVANS BURSAR, ON CUTTING DOWN SOME FINE COLLEGE TREES.

1. ON THE MONUMENT AT LONDON.

1. DRYDEN'S DESCRIPTION OF NIGHT BURLESQUED" All things were huſh'd as Nature's ſelf lay dead," The mountains ſeem to nod their drowſy head;" The little birds in dreams their ſongs repeat," And ſleeping flowers beneath the night-dew ſweat."

This Opera may ſafely be aſcribed to Sir William Davenant. It was firſt acted at the time and place and in the manner before deſcribed, and afterwards introduced by the author into "The Playhouſe to be let." See a liſt of his dramatic writings in the new edition of Dodſley's Old Plays, vol. VIII. N.. 1658.

1. CHLORIS APPEARING IN A LOOKING-GLASS.

1. ON THE NUMBER THREE.

1. ESSAY ON THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF POETRYThis and the preceding Poems by Dr. Parnell (as has been already ſaid of Dr. Yalden) were omitted in the former collection only becauſe they could not then be met with. I cannot but take this opportunity of correcting a miſtake (which I was led into by Dr. Birch) in the note on the Engliſh Poets, vol. XLIV. p. 263. What is there ſaid on the Poem on Queen Anne's Peace more probably belongs to this Eſſay. The peace was not ſigned till March 30, 1713. By Swift's Journal to Stella, Dec. 22, 25, 1712, Jan. 6. 17, 31, and Feb. 19, 1712-13, it appears that this poem received ſeveral corrections in conſequence of hints from Dr. Swift, who introduced Parnell both to Oxford and Bolingbroke. N..

1. THE COUNTER-SCUFFLETheſe poems are preſerved on account of the many droll anecdotes they contain. "The Chimney's Scuffle, 1662," a very indifferent poem, ſeems to have given riſe to this and many other of ſimilar titles; among others, to
"Fragmenta Carceris; or, The King's-Bench Scuffle; with the Humours of the Common-ſide; the King's-Bench Litany, and the Legend of Duke Humphrey, by Samuel Speed, a Member of that Royal Society, 1675."
N., 1670. WHEREUNTO IS ADDED, THE COUNTER-RAT, WRITTEN BY R. S.Theſe initials are poſſibly intended for Sir Roger L'Eſtrange; who, among other viciſſitudes of fortune, ſpent near ſix years in gaols, and almoſt four under a ſentence of death in Newgate. — Richard Steere, the only contemporary poet I can find with theſe initials, was author of ſome well-meaning, but indifferent, verſes on a religious ſubject, called,
"The Hiſtory of the Babyloniſh Cabal; or the Intrigues, Progreſſion, Oppoſition, Defeat, and Deſtruction, of the Daniel-Catchers, 1682."

1. LINES BY MR. HIGGONSSee an account of this writer, and ſome of his poems, vol. I. p. 125; and in this volume, p. 111. — I have ſince been told, that he publiſhed a poem on the Peace of Utrecht; and had ſome others by him, which he intended for the preſs. He was firſt couſin to the late earl Granville. Two lines of his verſes on the Death of Waller, vol., I. p. 130, are evidently to be traced in the following couplet of Tickell, in the Engliſh Poets, vol. XXV. p. 188.
